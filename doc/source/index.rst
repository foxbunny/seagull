Seagull user guide
==================

Seagull is an open-source skinnable phot gallery app written in Python and
released under the GNU General Public License.

This guide explains how to start, customize, and deploy Seagull in a production
environment. Since Seagull is relatively simple in design, most of the space
will be spent on the customization aspect. The guide is written in the tutorial 
style to ease new users into the matter, but basic knowledge of Python, HTML,
and CSS will definitely go a long way towards making the reading experience
much easier.
